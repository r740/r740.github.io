        <p>Listen Up! Let's say you drink too much strawberry milk, and have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. But it's cold outside your bed. You don't want to get up, but the urge to urinate is just too strong! You make up your mind to go! <br>You run to the bathroom, stand in front of the toilet, and let loose! You think that all your life has led to this moment! But then you realize: it isn't the bathroom - you're still in bed! That feeling of lukewarm wetness spreads like wildfire!<br> But you don't stop! You can't stop! That's what I'm talking about! That's the truth of strawberry milk!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Listen Up!</strong> Let's say you drink too much strawberry milk, and have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. But it's cold outside your bed. You don't want to get up, but the urge to urinate is just too strong! You make up your mind to go! You run to the bathroom, stand in front of the toilet, and let loose! You think that all your life has led to this moment! But then you realize: it isn't the bathroom - you're still in bed! That feeling of lukewarm wetness spreads like wildfire! But you don't stop! You can't stop! That's what I'm talking about! <em>That's the truth of strawberry milk!</em></p>
